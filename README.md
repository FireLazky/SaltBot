## How to add new memes

Simply create a new pull request, in which you add the new mp3's to ![SaltBot/sound_bytes/memes_raw/](https://github.com/Oskari-Tuormaa/SaltBot/tree/master/SaltBot/sound_bytes/memes_raw).

The ![run.sh](https://github.com/Oskari-Tuormaa/SaltBot/blob/master/run.sh) script will automatically restart the bot and load the mp3's when the pull request is authorized.
